function usage () {
  cat <<USAGE
Usage: $0 COMMITISH [REPO [SUBDIRECTORY [OLD_SUBDIRECTORY]]]

Fetch the new compiler sources and patch Merlin to keep Merlin's local copies of
things in sync.  By default, this will pull the COMMITISH branch from
<$repository> and look in "$subdirectory/" for the compiler source, but the
branch can be overridden by any commitish (branch, tag, full (not abbreviated!)
commit hash, etc.), the repository can be overridden by any URL, and the
subdirectory can be overriden by any path (including ".").

This attempts to import new files from the compiler by running the
"import_added_ocaml_source_files.sh" script. If that doesn't work, you can also
try making matched pairs of files in this repository with the right names: one
in "upstream/ocaml_flambda/", and one in "src/ocaml".  Then running the script
will pull in the named file(s).

The SUBDIRECTORY argument is useful when importing from a repository that buries
the relevant compiler files inside a subdirectory. This used to be the case for
flambda (files were under an "ocaml/" direcotry), although it is no longer the
case. The OLD_SUBDIRECTORY argument is useful for when the directory structure
has changed since the last import.

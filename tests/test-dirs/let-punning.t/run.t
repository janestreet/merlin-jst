Test that locating a variable in a punned let goes to the original definition of the
variable rather than the new definition. i.e., in:
 1. let x = ... in
 2. let* x in
locating the x on line 2 goes to the definition on line 1.

Test that locating a variable bound in a punned let goes to the definition. i.e in:
 1. let x = ... in
 2. let* x in
 3. x
locating the x on line 3 goes to the definition on line 2.

Test that getting the type of a variable in a punned let returns the type of the newly
bound variable. i.e. in:
 1. let x : int option = ... in
 2. let* x in
the type-enclosing of x on line 2 is [int], not [int option].

The type for all the below tests should be [int], not [int option].

let*
  $ type_enclosing 13:9
  int
      let* a in
           ^

parallel let*
  $ type_enclosing 20:9
  int
      let* a and* b in
           ^
  $ type_enclosing 20:16
  int
      let* a and* b in
                  ^

sequential let*
  $ type_enclosing 27:9
  int
      let* a in
           ^
  $ type_enclosing 28:9
  int
      let* b in
           ^

Test that finding occurrences of a variable in a punned let finds the occurrences of the
newly defined variable, rather than the original one. i.e., in:
 1. let x = ... in
 2. let* x in
 3. x
finding occurrences of x on line 2 returns the definition on line 2 and the usage on
line 3.

           ^

Test that finding occurrences of a variable includes usages in a punned let. i.e., in:
 1. let x = ... in
 2. let%bind x in
finding occurrences of x on line 1 returns the definition on line 1 and the usage on
line 2.

(** As mentioned in the .mli file, there are some gory details around the
    particular translation scheme we adopt for moving to and from OCaml ASTs
    ([Parsetree.expression], etc.).  The general idea is that we adopt a scheme
    where each novel piece of syntax is represented as a pair of an extension
    node and an AST item that serves as the "body".  In particular, for an
    extension named [EXTNAME] (i.e., one that is enabled by [-extension EXTNAME]
    on the command line), the extension node used must be [[%jane.EXTNAME]]; for
    built-in syntax, we use [_builtin] instead of an extension name.  We also
    provide utilities for further desugaring similar applications where the
    extension nodes have the longer form [[%jane.FEATNAME.ID1.ID2.….IDn]] (with
    the outermost one being the [n = 0] case), as these might be used inside the
    [EXPR].  (For example, within the outermost [[%jane.comprehensions]] term
    for list and array comprehensions, we can also use
    [[%jane.comprehensions.list]], [[%jane.comprehensions.array]],
    [[%jane.comprehensions.for.in]], etc.).

    As mentioned, we represent terms as a "pair" and don't use the extension
    node payload; this is so that ppxen can see inside these extension nodes.
    If we put the subexpressions inside the extension node payload, then we
    couldn't write something like [[[%string "Hello, %{x}!"] for x in names]],
    as [ppx_string] wouldn't traverse inside the payload to find the [[%string]]
    extension point.

    Our novel syntactic features are of course allowed to impose extra
    constraints on what legal bodies are; we're also happy for this translation
    to error in various ways on malformed input, since nobody should ever be
    writing these forms directly.  They're just an implementation detail.

    See modules of type AST below to see how different syntactic categories
    are represented. For example, expressions are rendered as an application
    of the extension node to the body, i.e. [([%jane.FEATNAME] EXPR)].

    We provide one module per syntactic category (e.g., [Expression]), of module
    type [AST].  They also provide some simple machinery for working with the
    general [%jane.FEATNAME.ID1.ID2.….IDn] wrapped forms.  To construct one, we
    provide [make_jane_syntax]; to destructure one, we provide
    [match_jane_syntax].  We still have to write the transformations in both
    directions for all new syntax, lowering it to extension nodes and then
    lifting it back out. *)

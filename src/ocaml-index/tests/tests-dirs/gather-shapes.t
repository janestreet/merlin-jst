Jane Street only: This test demonstrates using the gather-shapes subcommand, which allows
us to avoid loading the cms files of dependencies.

  $ cat >main.ml <<EOF

  0 approx shapes: {}, and shapes for CUS .

Order matters; if we don't load the shapes file before the cms, we will fail to index
properly:
  $ ocaml-index aggregate -o main-out-of-order.merlin-index main.cms lib/lib.merlin-shapes
  $ ocaml-index dump main-out-of-order.merlin-index
  4 uids:

   uid: Main.2; locs: "b": File "main.ml", line 3, characters 4-5
   uid: Main.3; locs: "Bar": File "main.ml", line 4, characters 7-10 },

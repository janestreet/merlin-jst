Idea:
  - Stephen pointed out that the user doesn't want to be told that
    a half-written program's variable is local (meaning "it can't escape!")
    when really just its associated heap allocation is unconstrained
    (meaning, "right now it could be locally allocated")

    e.g.

    let x = Some y in
    ...

I propose to resolve this by saying:
  - querying for the mode of [x] should not be local.
  - querying for the mode of [Some _] *should* be local.

This is a little tricky because asking for the type of [Some]
will give you just the type of the constructor... so there's not
an easy way to get the "local"-ness.
So this should probably also give you the mode of the constructor
application expression it's used in.
